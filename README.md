## Profile Page
Make a folder for yourself with your name inside `/src/interns/`.

Make the page your own, including a picture meaningful to you (it doesn't have to be of you, but it can be!) and a paragraph about what you want to learn during an internship.  Make sure to cover what makes you want to be a software engineer and what sorts of software you'd like to create.

If you need inspiration for you `about me` page, you can view Larry Lobster's in the `/src/interns/` folder.

## Code Challenge
In the `/src/challenge` folder open up index.html in your preferred browser.  You'll find a combo lock that doesn't work.  Your job is to make the lock work & when the secret combo is entered, send us to your `about me` page.

To do this, open `/src/challenge/lock-logic.js` and read the instructions there to complete the changeDialValue function.  When the combo entered matches, you should use the redirect() function to send us to your `about me` page.

Be sure to lint your code - you can do that by running
```sh
npm install
npx eslint .
# or
# > npx eslint . --fix
# to automatically fix simple issues
```
